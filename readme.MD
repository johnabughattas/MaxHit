MaxHit is an addon for the PC game World of Warcraft(WoW). Addons add functionality to the game that the developer, Blizzard Entertainment, did not add themselves. 
Addons are sanctioned by Blizzard and have a thriving community of volunteer developers. 
There are over 10,000 addons available for download free at https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons, a third-party addon sharing site. 

To run the addon you will, of course, need to download WoW. You can download WoW at https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/download/
You'll also need to sign up for a BattleNet account at https://account.battle.net/creation/flow/creation-full. 
WoW comes with a free trial, so you won't need to pay anything to access the game. 

To install the addon, find the folder where you installed WoW. If you're on Windows, this is like "Program Files".
Then click on the folder "_retail_", then the folder "Interface". You should see a folder called addons. 
Drag my folder "MaxHit" into the addons folder. When you login to WoW, you should see an "addon" button in the bottom left of the character creation screen.
Clicking that button will show a list of all your installed addons and you should now see "Max Hit" listed.

If you've properly installed WoW and Max Hit, then Max Hit will greet you by your character's name in the chatbox upon login. 
(note: I added this greeting for fun, but no actual addon would do this since it would be incredibly annoying to be greeted by every addon you have installed)

Go fight some enemies and Max Hit will let you know in the chatbox whenever you land a new biggest hit!
It will also keep track of what ability you landed the attack with and against which enemy. 

If you want to know what your current max hits is you can type "/maxhit" in the chatbox.
Alternatively, you can access a GUI that will display your max hits.
By hitting escape, you'll bring up a menu. Click on options, then on "addons". You should see a drop down menu with all your enabled addons.
Click on "MaxHit" and you will see your max hits displayed.
